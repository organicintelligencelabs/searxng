# SearXNG Docker Template for Railway

> **Fork note (organicintelligencelabs, 2026-08-02).** This is a fork of
> [protemplate/searxng](https://github.com/protemplate/searxng), which Claos production
> previously deployed from directly. That repo is a third party's and was last updated
> 2025-06-09, yet it supplies `searxng/settings.yml`, whose `search.formats: [html, json]`
> is the single line the Claos `web-search` tool depends on. A deletion or an edit there
> would have broken production search silently. Forked so we own it.
>
> **Two deliberate divergences from upstream:**
> 1. The base image is **pinned** rather than `:latest`. Running unpinned meant the
>    instance sat on `2026.4.24` for three months without anyone knowing.
> 2. **Dependabot** watches the pinned tag weekly (`.github/dependabot.yml`) so upgrades
>    arrive as reviewable PRs.
>
> **After merging any base-image bump, verify against the deployed instance:**
> ```sh
> # 1. JSON API still answers (this is what web-search needs)
> curl -s "$SEARXNG_BASE_URL/search?q=test&format=json" | head -c 80
> # 2. Relevance did not regress (from the claos repo)
> node scripts/eval/bench-web-search.mjs
> ```
> Background: `logs/backlog-searxng-web-search-2026-07-31.md` in the claos repo.

## 🤖 AI Integration Guide

### FlowiseAI Integration

1. **Deploy** your SearXNG instance using the one-click button above
2. **Get your Railway URL** (e.g., `https://your-app.railway.app`)
3. **In FlowiseAI**:
   - Use the **HTTP Request** node
   - Set URL to: `https://your-app.railway.app/search?q={query}&format=json`
   - Method: `GET`
   - Use the JSON response in your AI workflows

### n8n Integration

1. **Add HTTP Request Node** in your n8n workflow
2. **Configure the request**:
   - URL: `https://your-app.railway.app/search`
   - Method: `GET` 
   - Parameters:
     - `q`: Your search query
     - `format`: `json`
     - `categories`: `general` (optional)
3. **Process the results** using n8n's data transformation nodes

### API Usage Examples

**Basic Search:**
```bash
curl "https://your-app.railway.app/search?q=artificial+intelligence&format=json"
```

**Search with Category:**
```bash
curl "https://your-app.railway.app/search?q=machine+learning&format=json&categories=general,it"
```

    }
  ]
}
```

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Scaling Your Instance

For high-traffic usage, adjust these environment variables:

```env
